      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had Covid for the last week. My last day before isolating was on December 22, a Friday, when I took the day off to visit my Grandma, Shirley, in hospice in St. Cloud, MN. A few weeks earlier, my folks, my sister, and myself had visited her, during the first full day she was in hospice, and she was doing well, in high spirits, but we knew her condition may worsen at any moment.</description>
