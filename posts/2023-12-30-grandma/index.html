			<h1>Grandma</h1>

			<div class="type_test">
				<p>I&rsquo;ve had Covid for the last week. My last day before isolating was on December 22, a Friday, when I took the day off to visit my Grandma, Shirley, in hospice in St. Cloud, MN. A few weeks earlier, my folks, my sister, and myself had visited her, during the first full day she was in hospice, and she was doing well, in high spirits, but we knew her condition may worsen at any moment.  I didn&rsquo;t know her the most deeply, and can count on one hand the number of times I had interacted with her in my adult life, but this would be my last time seeing her.</p>
<p>My folks had been at the hospice with my grandma since earlier in the day, and I sat with them for an hour or so while we listened to Grandma speak aloud about whatever it was she was thinking, or hallucinating, about. My folks left, and then I sat with Grandma for another two and a half hours, just listening to her, occassionaly speaking to her when she would grasp onto a moment of awareness. I left her around four in the afternoon, telling her I loved her and that I was leaving now. Sitting in that room with her made it more apparent how much of this woman was present in me, and my family, despite our infrequent and short lived visits with her and my grandfather throughout their lives.</p>
<p>She passed on Tuesday, December 26, in the latter part of the afternoon. I am thankful for the time I had to see her in hospice, thankful for the brief moments of clarity she experienced where she looked at me and shared thoughts and memories with me. Thankful for her holding my hand and speaking to me as if I was my brother Zachary, and letting her know I&rsquo;d tell him what she said.</p>
<p>It seems corny to say such a thing, but those few moments with my grandma turned up my awareness on what I am doing with my life, how I am engaging with the time I am given. There&rsquo;s no big answers I have arrived to, but I have generally felt a little bit more inclined to slow things down and breathe a bit.</p>
